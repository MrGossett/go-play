This is a test file. It has a long hex string at the end.

Here's some example code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

head -c 1024 /dev/zero > 1kzero
```

and then a long hex string:

"0782e4a854ed463374efba7979c2012927f1a9ae"

and a long base64 string:

"dBDMz7s3UFd6BjUIcii2dg=="

and some more text after all that.
